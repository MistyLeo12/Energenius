<h1>MISSION STATEMENT</h1>
<p>EnerGenius is focused on providing villagers in emerging markets with a cost effective, reliable, and efficient means of siphoning energy from the local power grid. Our goal is to develop an affordable energy plan that allows villagers to purchase and adapt to energy at their own rate.</p>

<h1>TARGET</h1>
<p> Audience makes 88-120 US dollars yearly and chooses not to pay for electricity even if the main grid is accessible to their village. Due to their low income, the current price/cost model for electricity forces them to purchase a less effective, more hazardous form of energy and prevents them from assimilating to this useful resource.</p>
