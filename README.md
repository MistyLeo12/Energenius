# Energenius
## About
EnerGenius is focused on providing villagers in emerging markets with a cost effective, reliable, and efficient means of siphoning energy from the local power grid. Our goal is to develop an affordable energy plan that allows villagers to purchase and adapt to energy at their own rate.

## What I did
Along with helping in researching about the topic, I designed the logo for the company and a quick landing page which was hosted on Heroku. This used in our pitch at the Hackathon and during our Hult Pitch. 

## What I learned
I learned how to quickly formulate a solution to an issue that I didn't know much about and design, create, and host a landing page with its own custom url quickly. 

## Project
This idea was created in 24 hours during HackDuke 2017. A lot of the time was spent doing mearket research and seeing if something like this would be feasible. The project was continued for a couple of months after the hackathon and entered into the Hult Competition but because of feasibility and not making into the final round of the compentition, no more work has been done with this project. **The website is no longer being hosted and pictures used in our Pitch have been removed**
